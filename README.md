# Bellew-Portfolio

This is my portfolio for potential boss to check out. I was motivated to get involved with the KU bootcamp program while I was sitting at home after a long 16 hour shift at work. I thought to myself, why am I doing this to my body. So I went online an decided that I do enjoy working with computers and it is growing in the world today. Why not give it a chance to help me grow as a person and to get involved in differnt job oppertunities. 
I am happy to try and build this portfolio to widen my horizons and get a better paying job to provide for my family. 
Doing project will hopfully land me a wonderful job so I dont have to miss so much family time and be with my loved ones, cause life is just to short nowadays. 
In this project I feel that I am struggling with a lot of the concepts, sunce jumping in knowing nothing of coding itself. I am starting to learn a lot. HTML and CSS are super complex when you look at it for the first time. That's alright i have google handy and taking it one day at a time. 
My project will stand out just as I do because I like to be different and stand out with my work. I want this to show case the skills I have leanred from knowing nothing on day one, til now. Look at what I have done. I am proud of where I came and where I am going. 
Thanks for reading.
